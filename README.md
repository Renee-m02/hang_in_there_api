# Hang in There API

### Project Description:

Week two of Turing we built a front end application for motivational posters. Week three we built a back end API database that a front end could use rather than having to hardcode our poster data. How cool is that? We built CRUD functionality in our back end API application. 


### Installation Instructions:
- Fork this repository.

Have Fun!
